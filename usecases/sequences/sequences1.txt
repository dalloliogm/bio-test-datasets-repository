1. Sequence convert
	The User needs to convert a sequence from fasta to a tabular format.
	In the tabular format, every line has two columns, the id of the sequence and its sequence.
	This format is easier to use with grep. 

2. Fasta file check
	The User needs to check whether a fasta file follows the right specification for fasta format.
	He wants to know whether all the sequences have a regular id, if there are blank lines, if all the lines are 80 characters width, and if they contains only character admitted by IUPAC for a certain alphabet.
	For example: unspecified nucleotide are described with N and not X, or something else.

3. Check whether a file contains repetitions of the same sequence
	The User wants to know whether a sequence is replicated in the same file. E.g., a fasta file contains two times the sequence 'seq1.fasta'.
	Parsers like SeqIO should return an error when parsing such files.
