These cases comes from the discussion on http://lists.open-bio.org/pipermail/open-bio-l/2008-December/000505.html

1.translate sequences using a codon table
Take a provided set of CDS nucleotide sequences in FASTA format,
translate them using NCBI codon table 11 (bacteria), and output the
results as a FASTA file of protein sequences.

2. Execute pairwise alignment using emboss-needle
Take a provided set of protein sequences, and do pairwise
alignments between them all using the EMBOSS tool needle.

3. Create a cladogram from a set of protein sequences
 Take a provided FASTA file of proteins, and run ClustalW on it
using the default settings.  Take the multiple sequence alignment in
ClustalW format, and covert it into Stockholm format.  Then build a
neighbour joining tree using quick-tree program (which cannot read in
ClustalW files directly).  Finally, load the tree file and produce a
cladogram where the taxon/leaf XXX is highlighted in red.


4. Querying pubmed for an author
 Take a provided author name and keyword, and query the NCBI Entrez
webinterface to get a list of matching papers.  Download these
references (maybe as MedLine format, maybe as XML) and parse the
result into a CSV file for input into your reference manager (e.g.
EndNote - or generate a bibtex file for use with LaTeX).

5. Download all ESTs sequenced for a specie
 Taking a provided species name, and use NCBI Entrez to download
all matching EST sequences to a FASTA format file.

6. blast a protein sequence against a local database
 Take a provided FASTA file of proteins and use standalone NCBI
BLASTP to search them against the NR database using a expectation
threshold of 10^-6 and at most ten alignments per query.  Parse the
results, and generate a new FASTA file of the protein sequences where
the description line includes the protein identifiers of closely
related entries found with BLAST.  [A more sensible approach to
automatic annotation would be nice, but more complicated]
